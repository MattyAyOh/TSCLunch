TSCLunch
========
How to use:
------
* Download the lunch responses from Google docs as a csv file, into (Script-Directory)/CSVResponses
* Make sure python 2.7.* is installed
* Run python script 
  * If using Windows, double click the script
  * If using Mac, open terminal cd to the script directory, and type `python lunch.py`
* The text displayed is now in your clipboard, you can paste it wherever.
  * NOTE: Do not close the script until you've pasted.  Closing the script CAN corrupt your clipboard, and will freeze the application you are pasting into.  If your clipboard becomes corrupted, then you'll need to copy a new item into it.
  * Hope to fix this bug eventually, but it also doesn't seem to happen all the time, and sometimes it just seems like it's thinking for a while
* Press Ctrl+C to exit the script
